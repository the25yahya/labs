Race Conditions: Introduce examples in Node.js and PHP where concurrent processing introduces unexpected results.
5. Cloud, Serverless, and Modern Security Concerns
Function-Level Injection in Serverless Functions: Inject malicious input into AWS Lambda functions written in Node.js or Python.
Misconfigured Cloud Metadata Exposure: SSRF/Direct access labs for cloud metadata in AWS/GCP environments.
Broken Authentication in APIs: Labs for poorly secured token-based authentication in REST APIs (Node.js, Flask).
Excessive Data Exposure in GraphQL: Overly permissive data access in GraphQL APIs.
Additional Key Labs
6. CORS Misconfiguration Labs
Basic CORS Misconfiguration: Demonstrate allowing unrestricted cross-origin requests in Node.js and Flask.
Advanced CORS Attacks: Showcase exploitation techniques for CORS in scenarios with misconfigured credentials and origins.
7. Advanced SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)
Python Jinja2 Injection: Demonstrate how SSTI in Python's Jinja2 can lead to code execution.
PHP Twig Injection: Show SSTI in PHPâ€™s Twig templates.
Node.js Pug Engine Injection: Demonstrate SSTI in the Pug template engine.
Suggested Structure for Building Labs
Document Lab Objectives: Each vulnerability should have a detailed objective and historical context.
Progression in Difficulty: Start with basic labs (XSS, SQLi) and work up to complex issues (SSTI, CORS).
Real-World Scenarios: Where possible, use real-world applications or custom web apps to mimic vulnerabilities.
This approach gives a comprehensive picture of web vulnerabilities through time, addressing early flaws and progressively tackling more sophisticated modern issues like CORS misconfigurations and SSTI vulnerabilities.
